# How:
Using Google Domains, my own Raspberry Pi and router configuration I have successfully started and hosted my own website using my Raspberry Pi. In doing this, I have implemented
use of crontab (automating DNS server updates), port forwarding, PHP, MySQL, and basic HTML
to ensure my website stays up and running even when I am away from home.
# Why:
In creating and coding my own website I hope to grow in my understanding of how websites are
configured and hosted, as well as advance my knowledge in HTML to truly customize and create
a place where I can showcase my projects.
# Reflection:
The only true challenge I faced was in regards to my router configuration settings, as they
can be difficult to set and change depending on your ISP/brand of router. I plan to continue
development of my website to create something truly captivating and enjoyable for both
the user and myself, next implementing the use of CSS and JavaScript to create something truly personalized.
