    <h4>High School:</h4>
    <h5>GPA: ~3.76</h5>
    <p>
      I attended high school at St. Maria Goretti, located in my hometown Hagerstown, Maryland. I graduated from there in 2016, while
      I simultaneously accepted the Natioal Army ROTC 3-Year Scholarship which would allow me to contract with the Army at the start of
      my Sophomore year of college.

    <h5>GPA: ~3.55</h5>
    <p>
      For almost four years now I've attended Loyola University Maryland, where I major in Computer Science while minoring in Mathematics.
      While in school, I take part in our Army ROTC program on campus, serve as our Army Ten Miler Team captain, UAV Club Co-President,
      and member of our Cybersecurity Club. In addition, I work part time in our Technology Services department as a Stduent Technician.
      I thoroughly enjoy the work I do in my Computer Science and Math related coursework, along with the physcial and mental challenges
      of ROTC.
