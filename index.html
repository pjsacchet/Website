    <h4>A Little About Me:</h4>
    <p>
        Welcome to my website! <em>(currently in development)</em> My name is Patrick Sacchet, a current senior at Loyola University Maryland.
        I'm currently on track to graduate May 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. Along with this, I am a contracted cadet in our
        Army ROTC program (set to commission May 2020), a member of our Cybersecurity Club, UAV Club (co-president), and Army Ten Miler team (team captain). With all of this
        I also work part time on campus during the school year as a Student Technician in our Technology Services Department, and work full time over breaks as a Software
        Engineering Intern at Raytheon performing work in their cybersecurity field.
