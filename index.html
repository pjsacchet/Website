    <p>
      Welcome to my website! <em>(currently in development)</em> My name is Patrick Sacchet, a current senior at Loyola University Maryland.
      I'm currently on track to graduate May 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics. Along with this, I am a contracted cadet in our
      Army ROTC program (set to commission May 2020), a member of our Cybersecurity Club, UAV Club(co-president), and Army Ten Miler team (team captain). With all of this
      I also work part time on campus during the school year as a Student Technician in our Technology Services Department, and work full time over breaks as a Software
      Engineering Intern at Raytheon performing work in their cybersecurity field.
