    <h3>Pac-Man</h3>
    <h4>Language: JavaScript/HTML</h4>
    <h4><a href="https://github.com/pjsacchet/Pac-Man" title="Pac-Man link">Github link</a></h4>
    <p>
      In this project, I chose to recreate a version of Pac-Man that was one of my own. This project included multiple concepts taught in
      my Computer Graphics class, including: object collision, timing/queues of audio events, user interface/interaction, and basic 2D
      modeling to successfully create my own version of Pac-Man. I found this project to be incredibly enjoyable, as I got hands on experience
      with JavaScript and got to create a game many of my friends and family members enjoyed playing.

    <h3>Antivirus Program</h3>
    <h4>Language: Python</h4>
    <h4><a href="https://github.com/pjsacchet/Antivirus" title="Antivirus link">Github link</a></h4>
    <p>
      In this project I aimed to create a my own mock version of a antivirus program implementing Yara signature detection. This project
      is not yet complete, as more advanced features (GUI, signature database, multithreaded searching) will take a re work of my code
      in order to be properly implemented. I've enjoyed this project very much so far, and have thus far created a very simple command line
      search engine that will trigger on all files containing the string 'test'. I've configured the starting directories appropiately for each
      OS, and search them using Python's directory 'top down' search approach. I look forward to continuing this project and having a more
      complete product once more work has been completed on this website.

    <h3>Automated Email Service</h3>
    <h4>Language: Python</h4>
    <h4><a href="https://github.com/pjsacchet/Automated-Emails" title="Automated email link">Github link</a></h4>
    <p>
      In trying to come up with some way I could keep my team members updated on their training while I was away at Fort Knox over the
      summer I realized I wnated to implement a Python script that could somehow send emails to each team member each week with their
      corresponding training. In setting out to do this, I obtained and implemented a Raspberry Pi that runs on my own home network that
      has all Excel files for my team members and the python script that sends these emails every Monday at 0800 (automated using Cron).
      Accomplishing this felt very rewarding, and receiving feedback from my team members on how much it helped them throughout the
      summer encouraged me to look for more projects where I could automate tasks to help both myself and others in some way.
    </p>
    <h3>Website</h3>
    <h4>Language: HTML/CSS/JavaScript</h4>
    <h4><a href="https://github.com/pjsacchet/Website" title="Website link">Github link</a></h4>
    <p>
      Of course every Computer Science student dreams of their own website they built from scratch that they <em>themselves</em> host, so
      I did just that! Slowly realizing the potential of my small Raspberry Pi  I realized I could host my own website on a webserver on
      my Raspberry Pi. This was accomplished via port forwarding to my PI where it would have all HTML and other required files ready to
      send back to whoever was requesting to see my webpage. In addition, because I am using Google Domains for hosting my Domain name, I
      have a script on the Pi that will automatically check for DNS updates every hour and let Google know if there have been any changes.
      This all of course is still a work in progress, as I am just now still developing the backbone of the website via HTML before moving
      on to CSS and JavaScript to make my website actually visually appealing. Sure, there are plenty of easy to use website building tools
      available, but it's so much more fun doing it yourself!

    <h5>Please Note:</h5>
    <p>
      While the projects here are primarily written in Python, HTML and JavaScript I also have a substantive understanding and incredible experience
       with C and Java in previous course work.
