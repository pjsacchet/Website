    <h3>Student Technician</h3>
    <h4>Location: Loyola University Maryland</h4>
    <h4>Duration: 2016 - Present</h4>
    <p>
      While working at Loyola as a Student Technician I have had experience troubleshooting issues students encounter on sides relating to both hardware and
      software. These issues include: Wifi connectivity, HD and SSD repair/data replacement/transfer, virus detection/removal and application troubleshooting
      on both Windows and Mac platforms. Along with this, I have gained inccredible experience working with 'customers' that has tested my ability to work both alone
      and with my team members to solve issues encountered by students.

    <h3>Software Engineering Intern</h3>
    <h4>Location: Raytheon</h4>
    <h4>Duration: 2018 - Present</h4>
    <p>
      In looking for some sort of programnming job in a military/government associated company I applied for the National Security Scholarship Program. It was
      through this process I successfully obtained a T.S. security clearance which would allow me to receive an offer from Raytheon working as a Software Engineer
      in their cybersecurity field. Since I've started, I've gotten to work with projects concerning: antivirus characterization, malware signature detection and
      reverse engineering. I hope to continue my work and experience in this field so to one day be able to call it my career.
